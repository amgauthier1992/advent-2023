1. Edit and replace all plaintext data with a RegEx (Ctrl + F & Alt & R)
   a. ^(.+)$
   b. '$1', (wraps everything in quotation marks and appends a comma at the end of each line)

2. Again using vscode hotkeys
    1. Ctrl+A to select all or select your desired text. 
    2. Shift+Alt+I to put a cursor at the end of each line. Type your ' (or whatever you want at the end). 
    3. Home will move all your cursors to the beginning of the lines. Type your ' (or whatever you want at the beginning of all the lines).

3. Or use fs.readFileSync(fileName, 'utf-8').trim().split('\n'); //converts data to array of strings, separated by new lines
